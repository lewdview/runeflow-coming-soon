# Automation Templates

## Description
Templates for creating automated workflows, task scheduling, conditional logic processing, and trigger-based actions to streamline business processes and eliminate manual tasks.

### Inputs/Parameters
- **Trigger Conditions**: Events, schedules, webhooks, or data changes that initiate workflows
- **Decision Logic**: Conditional rules and branching logic for workflow routing
- **Action Parameters**: Specific tasks to execute (send email, update database, call API)
- **Variables**: Dynamic data passed between workflow steps
- **Schedule Settings**: Cron expressions, intervals, or specific times for recurring tasks
- **Error Handling**: Fallback actions, retry policies, and failure notifications
- **Approval Workflows**: Human-in-the-loop processes requiring manual approval

### Processing Logic/AI Prompt Skeleton
```
Automation Workflow Configuration:
Name: {workflow_name}
Trigger: {trigger_type} - {trigger_condition}
Schedule: {schedule_expression}

Workflow Steps:
1. Trigger Activation:
   - Monitor for: {trigger_condition}
   - Validate trigger data: {validation_rules}
   - Initialize workflow variables

2. Conditional Processing:
   IF {condition_1}:
     - Execute: {action_1}
     - Set variables: {variable_assignments}
   ELSE IF {condition_2}:
     - Execute: {action_2}
     - Send notification: {notification_target}
   ELSE:
     - Default action: {default_action}

3. Task Execution:
   FOR EACH {data_item} IN {data_source}:
     - Process: {processing_logic}
     - Apply transformations: {transformation_rules}
     - Execute actions: {action_sequence}

4. Completion Handling:
   - Log results: {logging_configuration}
   - Send completion notifications: {completion_notifications}
   - Update status: {status_update_location}
   - Schedule next run: {next_schedule}

Error Handling:
- Retry failed steps: {retry_count} times
- Alert on critical failures: {alert_channels}
- Execute fallback actions: {fallback_procedures}

Monitoring: Track execution times, success rates, resource usage
```

### Expected Outputs
- **Workflow Execution Results**: Success/failure status with detailed logs
- **Automated Actions**: Completed tasks such as emails sent, data updated, files processed
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution times, throughput, error rates
- **Notifications**: Alerts and status updates sent to relevant stakeholders
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of workflow executions and decisions made

### Example
**Input**: Automated customer onboarding workflow
```json
{
  "trigger": "new_customer_signup",
  "conditions": {
    "customer_type": "premium",
    "account_value": "> $1000"
  },
  "actions": [
    "send_welcome_email",
    "create_crm_record",
    "schedule_onboarding_call",
    "provision_premium_features"
  ]
}
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "workflow_execution": {
    "status": "completed",
    "execution_time": "2.3 seconds",
    "steps_completed": 4,
    "customer_id": "CUST-2024-001"
  },
  "actions_performed": {
    "welcome_email": "sent to customer@example.com",
    "crm_record": "created in Salesforce with ID: 003XX0000004DcH",
    "onboarding_call": "scheduled for 2024-01-16 at 2:00 PM",
    "premium_features": "activated for account"
  },
  "next_steps": "Onboarding call reminder will be sent 24 hours before appointment"
}
```

## Automation Patterns

### Event-Driven Automation
```
1. External system sends webhook
2. Event data validated and parsed
3. Workflow triggered based on event type
4. Conditional logic determines actions
5. Actions executed in parallel or sequence
6. Results logged and notifications sent
```

### Scheduled Automation
```
1. Cron job or scheduler triggers workflow
2. Data collected from various sources
3. Processing logic applied to data
4. Results compared to previous runs
5. Actions taken based on changes
6. Next execution scheduled
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Automation
```
1. Automated process reaches decision point
2. Request sent to human approver
3. Workflow paused waiting for approval
4. Human reviews and makes decision
5. Workflow continues based on approval
6. Final actions executed and logged
```

## Best Practices
- Design workflows with clear error handling and recovery
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Use idempotent operations to handle retries safely
- Separate configuration from workflow logic
- Test workflows thoroughly in staging environment
- Implement proper security and access controls
- Document workflow purposes and decision logic
- Plan for scalability and high availability
- Monitor resource usage and optimize performance
- Maintain backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Version control workflow definitions
- Provide clear dashboards and status visibility
