## 🚨 Critical Issue Identified

**Problem**: Netlify functions are not deployed or configured correctly
**Impact**: Email capture is completely broken
**Urgency**: HIGH - visitors can't sign up

## 🛠️ Immediate Fix Options

### Option 1: Quick Switch to Railway (RECOMMENDED)
**Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Outcome**: Full functionality immediately

Steps:
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Add environment variables 
3. Configure custom domain runeflow.xyz
4. Switch DNS to Railway

### Option 2: Fix Netlify Functions
**Time**: 30-60 minutes  
**Risk**: May still have issues
**Outcome**: Keep free tier but need debugging

## 🎯 Railway Deployment Status

**Need to check**: Is Railway actually deployed and working?
**Next test**: Find Railway's temporary URL and test endpoints

### Quick Railway Test Needed:
```bash
# Find Railway URL from dashboard, then test:
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/capture-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com"}'
```

## 📱 User Impact Assessment

### Current User Experience:
- ✅ **Landing page works** - visitors see professional site
- ❌ **Can't sign up** - email capture button doesn't work
- ❌ **No lead generation** - losing potential customers
- ❌ **No analytics** - can't track visitor engagement

### Business Impact:
- **HIGH**: Email list building is broken
- **MEDIUM**: Professional appearance maintained  
- **LOW**: Site is still discoverable and loads fast

## 💡 Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes):
1. **Find Railway dashboard** and check deployment status
2. **Test Railway endpoints** directly (bypassing DNS)
3. **If Railway works**: Switch domain to Railway
4. **If Railway broken**: Fix Railway first, then switch

### Secondary (This week):
1. **Fix Netlify functions** as backup
2. **Set up monitoring** for both deployments
3. **Implement failover** strategy
