## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Before (CORS Error):

- ✅ Functions successfully deployed and accessible
- ✅ nodemailer.createTransport() fixed

## 🎯 Key Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript API Endpoint Update
```javascript
// In assets/js/coming-soon.js
const success = await submitToWaitlist(
  `${API_BASE_URL}/.netlify/functions/capture-email`, 
  email, 
  isFreePack ? window.selectedFreeRune : null
);
```

### 2. Enhanced CORS Headers
```javascript
// In netlify/functions/capture-email.js
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, GET, OPTIONS',
  'Access-Control-Max-Age': '86400'
};
```

### 3. Fixed Nodemailer Method
```javascript
// Before: nodemailer.createTransporter()
// After: nodemailer.createTransport()
```

### 4. Clean Build Process
- Removed macOS resource fork files (`._*`)
