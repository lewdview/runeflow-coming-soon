# 📧 Email Flow Explanation

## 🤔 Where Did the Test Email Go?

### Current Test Email Setup:
- **Sent TO**: `hello@runeflow.xyz` ← **This doesn't exist!**
- **Sent FROM**: `bmeason@gmail.com` (via Gmail SMTP)
- **"From" Display**: `RuneFlow Team <hello@runeflow.xyz>`

## 🚨 The Issue:
The test email was sent to `hello@runeflow.xyz`, but **you don't have email hosting for runeflow.xyz** yet, so the email bounced or went nowhere.

## ✅ The Solution:

### Option 1: Test with Your Gmail (Quick)
Send test email to your Gmail address to see it working:

```bash
# Edit test email to send to your Gmail
SMTP_TEST_EMAIL=bmeason@gmail.com node test-email.js
```

### Option 2: Check Gmail for Bounce Messages
The test email to `hello@runeflow.xyz` may have bounced back to your Gmail inbox. Check for:
- Bounced email notifications
- Delivery failure messages
- Undelivered mail notifications

## 📧 How Email Works in Production:

### When Visitors Sign Up:
1. **Visitor enters email**: `visitor@gmail.com`
2. **System sends welcome email**:
   - **TO**: `visitor@gmail.com` ← **This works!**
   - **FROM**: `bmeason@gmail.com` (Gmail SMTP)
   - **"From" Display**: `RuneFlow Team <hello@runeflow.xyz>`
3. **Visitor receives email** in their inbox

### Admin Notifications:
1. **System sends notification TO**: `hello@runeflow.xyz`
2. **Problem**: This email doesn't exist
3. **Solution**: Change to `bmeason@gmail.com`
